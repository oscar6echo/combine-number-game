# Combine Numbers Game

In French, "Le Compte est Bon".

Given several numbers, usually 6, and a target, usually a larger number, the player must find a sequence of operations (+, -, *, /) applied to the numbers to reach or approach the target.

For example:
+ Target: 335
+ Numbers; 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9

A solution is:
((9 * 7) + 4) * (3 + 6 / 2) = (63 + 4) * (3 + 2) = 67 * 5 = 335

For a list of all solutions, see the notebook [solve.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oscar6echo/combine-number-game/blob/master/game.ipynb).
